
Remove N and Count
The program must accept an integer N and a series of integers as the input. The program must remove all occurrences of N and print the count of remaining integers in the series as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The next line contains the series of integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of integers as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2
12352
Output: 3
Explanation:
Here N = 2. So after removing all the occurrences of 2, the series becomes 1 3 5.
Now the series contains only 3 integers. Hence 3 is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
a= len(1)
a=a-(1.count(n))
print(a)
